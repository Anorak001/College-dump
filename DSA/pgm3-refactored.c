To explain the given code, let's go through each part step by step:

1. The program starts with importing the necessary libraries - `stdio.h` for standard input and output functions, `ctype.h` for character manipulation, and `math.h` for mathematical operations such as power calculation using the pow() function.

2. Three global variables are defined: char stack[100] to store the expression elements, int top to keep track of the current position in the stack, and void push() and char pop() functions for pushing and popping elements from the stack, respectively.

3. Inside the main function, the user is prompted to enter an infix expression using scanf().

4. The entered expression is stored in a character array called 'exp'.

5. The loop at the bottom of the main function converts the infix expression into postfix format by iterating through each character in the expression. During this process, characters are either printed directly if they are alphanumeric or pushed onto the stack if they are operators. Parentheses are handled separately to ensure correct order of operations.

6. The content of the stack is then displayed as the postfix expression.

7. Another loop inside the main function evaluates the postfix expression using stacks, calculating the result and printing it out.

8. Inside this second loop, each character in the postfix expression is processed. If it's a number, it is pushed onto the stack. Operators are handled based on their precedence rules: they are executed by popping two operands from the stack, performing the desired operation, and pushing the result back to the stack. Parentheses are also handled accordingly, making sure that all operations inside parentheses are performed first.

9. Once the loop completes, the final result is popped from the stack and printed out for the user.

This program supports various operators like '+', '-', '*', '/', '%', and alphanumeric operands. It handles both parenthesized and free-parenthesized expressions, allowing for more complex calculations.
